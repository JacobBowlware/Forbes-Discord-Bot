# Forbes-Discord-Bot
Created in July of 2022, the Forbes400 Discord Bot provides all users in a discord server with access to real time Forbes 400 data. 
This application uses a pre-existing Forbes 400 API that gives me access to a JSON file which contains data related to all Forbes 400 members; 
Such as their: Name, Net-Worth, Business, etc. When requested, the bot will send an API request for updated data, parse through the data 
for your desired info, and then send the data in message format to your discord server text channel.
